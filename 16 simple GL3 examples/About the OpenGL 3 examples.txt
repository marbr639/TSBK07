About the OpenGL 3 examples
===========================

2017 revision

These are a set of very simple OpenGL 3.2 examples, moving through some basic functionality in small steps. This includes vertex/color/normal/texture coordinate buffers, basic transformations, textures, lighting and OBJ loading.

The code is written and mostly tested under MacOS X 10.7 or 10.8 using Lightweight IDE (version 0.9.5p+3 or better recommended). It has also been tested under Linux, but testing there is limited so bugs may creep in.

Under Linux, you can compile most (all) examples with a command line similar to this:

gcc whitetriangle.c ../../common/*.c ../../common/Linux/*.c -lGL -o whitetriangle -I../../common -I../../common/Linux -DGL_GLEXT_PROTOTYPES  -lXt -lX11 -lm

Makefiles? Sorry, for 16 demos I don't quite have the time right now. For Lightweight IDE you don't need one (major point with the program). I may produce a makefile later if I find the time.

In approximate order of complexity (which is pretty low for all of them):

White triangle
Rotation
Rotation animation
Colored triangle
Phong triangle
Textured quad
Textured quad inline
Color cube
Textured cube
Mipmapped cube
Rotating gouraud cube
Rotating phong cube
Perspective bunny
Rotating perspective bunny
Textured teapot
Perspective bunny 2

plus the folder "Common":
This folder holds a set of utility files:
- GL_utilities: The main feature here is the shader loader (which will move into MicroGLut in the future once the Linux version is stable).
- loadobj: Loads Wavefront OBJ 3D models. Note: Limited to simple models. Some models are built from multiple separate shapes, and we don't support that.
- LoadTGA: Loads TGA images to textures. TGA is a simple image format with alpha support, suited for laboratory work.
- MicroGlut: This is a GLUT subset, Mac/Linux/Windows. It is a really small cross-platform glue library.
- VectorUtils3: A math library mainly dealing with vectors and matrices relevant for computer graphics.

2017 revision: "White triangle bundled" was removed, not interesting and Mac specific, and "Perspective bunny 2" was added, demonstrating the higher-level usage of loadobj, where you can load and use OBJ files with very little code, more use of VectorUtils3, and a C++ version. Also, all demos are now updated to use MicroGlut regardless of platform.

Thanks to Jens Ogniewski for testing early versions under Linux.
